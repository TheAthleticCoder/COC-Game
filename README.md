# **COC-Game**

This is a 2D Python3 (terminal-based) game, heavily inspired by Clash of clans where the user will control the king, move it up, down, forward and backwards while destroying buildings and fighting defences on its way. The game demonstrates concepts of object-oriented programming (OOPS) and simulates a basic version of Clash Of Clans. 

**This game was created as part of the Spring 2021 Design and Analysis of Software Systems course.**

-----
## **Objective Of The Game:**

amount of loot while doing so. There will be an army of troops to help the king clean up.
